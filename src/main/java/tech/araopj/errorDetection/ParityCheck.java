/**
 * Parity Check (Vertical Redundancy Check) - A simple method of error detection is by adding redundant bits
 * called parity bits to each character.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>This method is called parity checking and is commonly used for ASCII characters where seven (7) bits
 *         are used for actual character encoding, and the eighth bit is for parity.</li>
 *     <li>It comes in two (2) basic forms: even parity and odd parity. The basic concept of parity checking is
 *         that a bit is added to a string of bits to create either even parity or odd parity.</li>
 *     <li>With even parity, the 0 or 1 added to the string produces an even number of binary 1s.</li>
 *     <li>With odd parity, the 0 or 1 added to the string produces an odd number of binary 1s.</li>
 * </ul>
